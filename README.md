# Shortest-Path-Finder-Visualizator-using-Dijkstra's-algorithm
Greetings to Pathfinding Visualizer! This app was created out of my deep fascination with pathfinding algorithms, aiming to bring them to life through visual representation. I trust that you'll find as much joy exploring this visual tool as I did crafting it. Access it here: https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/#

# Algorithms used
This application was developed using these algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): The pioneer of pathfinding algorithms; ensures the shortest route.

A Search* (weighted): Arguably the premier pathfinding algorithm; utilizes heuristics to find the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Greedy Best-first Search (weighted): A swifter, heuristic-intensive variant of A*; does not promise the shortest path.

Swarm Algorithm (weighted): A blend of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not ensure the shortest path.

Convergent Swarm Algorithm (weighted): The expedited, heuristic-centric edition of Swarm; does not ensure the shortest path.

Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (weighted): Employing Swarm from both ends; does not ensure the shortest path.

Breath-first Search (unweighted): An excellent algorithm; guarantees the shortest path.

Depth-first Search (unweighted): A suboptimal choice for pathfinding; doesn't ensure the shortest path.

In addition to the aforementioned pathfinding algorithms, I've also incorporated a Recursive Division Maze Generation algorithm.
